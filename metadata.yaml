      Version 1.2

      Updates how tracking cookies are named. Previously, we appended the host name
      to the `_bhcl` cookie. This was required as beehiiv.com sites use the subdomain
      to distinguish between publications. We needed to make sure cookie values were
      unique to each publication.

      For advertisers, this could be problematic as customer acquisition could be on
      a different subdomain from conversion. Although in the manual pixel you could
      specify which host to get the cookie from, this was not possible in the GTM pixel.

      The Pixel now uses the correct cookie name and will automatically use and rename
      any existing cookies.

      Version 1.1

      Make changes to the base GTM pixel tag to ensure it functions similarly to
      the manual pixel.

      Since `sendPixel` is a `GET` and our backend requires a `POST` request, this
      version injects a `pixel-support.js` script to handle the POST request.

      In addition, a new `_bhp` profile cookie is automatically created as a `UUID`.

      And finally, after the event is sent to Apiary, it also sends the event to
      the GTM tag queue. All events are prefixed with `bhpx:` like `bhpx:pageview`.
