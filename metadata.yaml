      Version 1.1

      Make changes to the base GTM pixel tag to ensure it functions similarly to
      the manual pixel.

      Since `sendPixel` is a `GET` and our backend requires a `POST` request, this
      version injects a `pixel-support.js` script to handle the POST request.

      In addition, a new `_bhp` profile cookie is automatically created as a `UUID`.

      And finally, after the event is sent to Apiary, it also sends the event to
      the GTM tag queue. All events are prefixed with `bhpx:` like `bhpx:pageview`.
